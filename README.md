# Zero-to-mastery

1) Heart Disease Prediction project using tools such as python, pan das, numpy, matplotlib, scikitlearn (Classification Problem.
   The model used to make the project was RandomForestClassifier from Sklearn.ensemble.
   Outcome: Upto 91% precision.
   
2) Bulldozers price prediction project using tools such as  python, pan das, numpy, matplotlib, scikitlearn (Time Series Problem).
   The model used to make the project was RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble.
   Outcome: Using feature importance I found out that the size of the bulldozer was the major feature to predict the price.
   
3) Dog Classification project using  python, pan das, numpy, matplotlib, TensorFlow.
   I used transfer learning and used a pretrained model on TensorFlow.
